            <h2>Invasions by Barbarian tribes</h2>
            <p>The Empire spent the next several decades under constant threat before “the Eternal City” was raided again in 455, this time by the Vandals. 
                Finally, in 476, the Germanic leader Odoacer staged a revolt and deposed Emperor Romulus Augustulus. From then on, no Roman emperor would ever 
                again rule from a post in Italy, leading many to cite 476 as the year the Western Empire suffered its death blow.</p>

            <h2>Economic struggle and reliance on slave labor.</h2>
            <p>At the same time, the empire was rocked by a labor deficit. Rome’s economy depended on slaves to till its fields and work as craftsmen, 
                and its military might had traditionally provided a fresh influx of conquered peoples to put to work. But when expansion ground to a halt 
                in the second century, Rome’s supply of slaves and other war treasures began to dry up. A further blow came in the fifth century, when the 
                Vandals claimed North Africa and began disrupting the empire’s trade by prowling the Mediterranean as pirates. With its economy faltering 
                and its commercial and agricultural production in decline, the Empire began to lose its grip on Europe.</p>

            <h2>Education System</h2>
              <p>Children from rich families, however, were well schooled and were taught by a private tutor at home or went to what we would recognise as schools.
                In general, schools as we would recognise them, were for boys only. Roman schools were rarely an individual building but an extension of a shop 
                Education was very important to the Ancient Romans. The rich people in Ancient Rome put a great deal of faith in education. 
                While the poor in Ancient Rome did not receive a formal education. Children from rich families, however, were well schooled and were 
                taught by a private tutor at home or went to what we would recognise as schools. many still learned to read and write. In general, schools 
                as we would recognise them, were for boys only. Roman schools were rarely an individual building but an extension of a shop – separated from 
                the crowd by a mere curtain! Ezoic Boys being educated Learning in Roman schools was based on fear.</p>

            <h2>Over expsansion and militaery over spending</h2>
            <p> Rome’s sheer size made it difficult to govern, ineffective and inconsistent leadership only served to magnify the problem. 
                Being an emperor became a death sentence. Civil war thrust the empire into chaos, and more than 20 men took the throne in the span of only 75 years, 
                usually after the murder of their predecessor. The Praetorian Guard—the emperor’s personal bodyguards assassinated and installed new sovereigns at will, 
                and once even auctioned the spot off to the highest bidder. Roman citizens lost trust in their leadership. Even as Rome was under attack from outside forces, it was also crumbling from within thanks to a severe financial crisis. 
                Constant wars and overspending had significantly lightened imperial coffers, Oppressive taxation and inflation had widened the gap between rich and poor.</p>
